	Here are a few links to my Github page, as well as downloads for some of the projects that I have
	done throughout my career at Siena College, as a Computer Science major.  The downloadable links will contain ZIP files with the projects in them and a little information about the project and language necessary to use it.

    					This project is an infamous one in the Siena College Computer Science department.  The class,
    					CSIS-225 Object Oriented Progamming (OOP) is taught by Dr. Darren Lim.  The goal of this project
    					was to familiarize us with Java's graphical components and creating an application.<br>
    					<br>The game is based on the board game Ticket To Ride, the Germany version.

    					Lazer Maze is another board game that we emulated using Java in CSIS-225.  It is not as robust or
    					advanced as Ticket To Ride, but it uses the same concepts and techniques.
